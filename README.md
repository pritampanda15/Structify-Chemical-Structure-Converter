# Structify-Chemical-Structure-Converter
Structify is a lightweight and efficient tool for converting chemical structure file formats. Structify simplifies the process of converting between formats commonly used in computational chemistry and molecular docking workflows.

# Features:

SDF to PDBQT: Easily convert structure-data files to PDBQT for docking simulations.
SDF to MOL2: Transform SDF files into MOL2 format for visualization or further analysis.
MOL2 to PDBQT: Generate PDBQT files directly from MOL2 input.
PDB to PDBQT: Generate PDBQT files directly from PDB input.
